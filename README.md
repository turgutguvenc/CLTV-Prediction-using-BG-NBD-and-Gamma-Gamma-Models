This project focuses on predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) utilizing the BG-NBD and Gamma-Gamma models. The following sections outline the key steps involved:

Data Preparation:
Preparing and processing the dataset for analysis.

Expected Sales Forecasting with BG-NBD Model:
Forecasting expected sales using the BG-NBD model.

Expected Average Profit with Gamma-Gamma Model:
Estimating expected average profit utilizing the Gamma-Gamma model.

Calculation of CLTV with BG-NBD and Gamma-Gamma Model:
Calculating CLTV by integrating the BG-NBD and Gamma-Gamma models.

Formation of Segments Based on CLTV:
Creating customer segments based on CLTV values.

Functionality of the Study:
Functionalizing the study to automate the process for future analysis.

Sending Results to the Database:
Sending the derived results and insights to the database for storage and accessibility.

This repository contains the code and documentation for implementing and understanding the CLTV prediction process using BG-NBD and Gamma-Gamma models in Python.
